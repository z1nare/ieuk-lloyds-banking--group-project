# [Internship Experience UK](https://www.brightnetwork.co.uk/internship-experience-uk/): [Lloyds Banking Group](https://www.lloydsbankinggroup.com/) Engineering project
## July 2025. Sector Skills Project: Engineering.

## Project Overview:
### I've joined a small but fast-growing music media startup facing critical server performance issues due to a surge in web traffic. While the increase in visitors is a positive sign of growth, some traffic appears to be non-human (bots), overwhelming the servers and causing frequent downtime. This project uses log file analysis to diagnose traffic patterns, identify potential bot traffic, and suggest cost-effective mitigation strategies that can be implemented by a small engineering team.

## Objective:
* Analyze web server logs to identify suspicious or excessive activity.

* Determine the root cause of frequent service disruptions.

* Recommend affordable and scalable solutions for bot management and traffic control.

## Project structure:
### For this project I used Jupyter Notebook - `ieuk-project.ipynb`. All required libraries are in `requirements.txt` and all plots are in `plots`.
